			<h1>Music comparison</h1>
			<div>
				<h2 class='example'>What's the purpose of this page?</h2>
				<p>We are two computer science undergraduates currently researching Music Information Retrieval.</p>
				<p>The purpose is to investigate if we can automatically predict how similar two songs are by using machine learning algorithms.</p>
				<p>To train these algorithms we need data from users on how similar some song pairs are, and that is how you can help!</p>
			</div>
			
			<div>
				<h2 class='example'>How does it work?</h2>
				<p>By listening to samples of two songs and then rating how similar you find them, you provide us with the data we need.</p>
				<p>As a warmup, you will be presented with three example pairs. After rating a pair you will be shown a suitable rating for that pair.</p>
				<p>When you have completed the examples, you will be eligible to rate the main set of song pairs.</p>
				<p>In total, there are 10 songs and 45 pairs of songs to rate. You will never be asked to rate the same <b>pair</b> of songs more than once.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div>
				<p>Every song pair you rate will help us immensely, so thanks in advance!</p>
