==========
This is the web application for my bachelor's degree research.
The main purpose of the application is to play two songs in a row and let the user rate the similarity between these.
The result is saved in a database and will be used to teach machine learning algorithms applied on the Million Song Dataset (MSD).
The goal is to investigate if the similarity between two songs can be automatically determined from the data in the MSD.
